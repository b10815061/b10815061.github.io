    In the annotation page, the annotator selects the target interval by dragging the yellow bar (visible in the right figure). And type in instructions to guide the learner, alternatively, annotators are welcome to record audio by clicking the red button at the top left to start recording. The speaking will then be processed into text using Whisper.
